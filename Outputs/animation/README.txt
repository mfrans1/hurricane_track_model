Animating forecasts

This folder is how I animated the forecasts made by the model, essentially making a png file at each timestep and then using ffmpeg to make it an mp4. 

In the interest of not having 3192 pngs on my laptop, I deleted them after the mp4 was made. Those downloading this repo, feel free to make em again if you are so inclined.
